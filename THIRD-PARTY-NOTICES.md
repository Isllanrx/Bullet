# Third-party notices

Bullet's own source code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). This file lists the third-party
components Bullet uses or depends on and the terms they come with.

## Bullet Native Engine & DLL (Proprietary Subsystem)

The Bullet Native Injector Engine `bullet-br.exe`, Bullet Native DLL `bullet-br.dll`,
and associated native IPC protocols are **closed-source proprietary components** maintained in a private repository
(`Isllanrx/bullet_dll`) and owned exclusively by Isllan Toso.

1. **Not Open Source:** They are **NOT** covered by the open-source MIT License of this repository.
2. **Commercial Restriction:** Under no circumstances may the native binaries, DLL, injector, or related protocols
   be sold, relicensed, monetized, or bundled into commercial or paid products.
3. **Anti-Reverse Engineering & AI Model Restriction:** Reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, dynamic
   hooking, protocol extraction, or automated reconstruction of the native engine and DLL binaries by any human,
   automated reverse-engineering suite, or AI model / agent pipeline is strictly prohibited.

## Rust crates

`bullet.exe` statically links open-source Rust crates from [crates.io](https://crates.io). Every crate in the
dependency graph uses a permissive license, except the Slint interface toolkit (below). The accepted set is
enforced in CI by `cargo deny` (see `deny.toml`):

| License | Crates (approx.) |
| --- | --- |
| MIT and/or Apache-2.0 (dual or single) | ~175 |
| Unicode-3.0 | 19 |
| BSD-3-Clause, BSD-2-Clause, 0BSD | 5 |
| ISC | 5 |
| Zlib | 4 |
| CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (Mozilla CA bundle via `webpki-roots`) | 2 |
| BSL-1.0 | 2 |
| Unlicense, CC0-1.0 or MIT-0 (as an option) | 4 |

For the exact list with versions and license texts, run:

```powershell
cargo deny list          # every crate and its license
cargo tree --edges normal --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

The Apache-2.0 and BSD licenses require their copyright notices to travel with binaries. Those notices are
included in each crate's source, which is available from crates.io at the versions pinned in `Cargo.lock`.

## Reference projects

Bullet was built by studying the projects listed in the README's acknowledgements. No source code from them
is included, and no third-party injector is used or shipped. Where a reference is GPL-licensed, Bullet
reimplements the behavior it needs independently.
